Getting extractframes
=====================

This documentation is for extractframes version |version|.

The latest documentation should always be available at http://tgs.github.com/extractframes/

You can always get the latest released version at
https://einstein.psych.indiana.edu/downloads/python/ (if you work in our lab at IU), or from
GitHub at https://github.com/tgs/extractframes

Download the latest .zip file for extractframes, and then either run
``easy_install extractframes-a.b.zip`` or extract it and run ``python
setup.py install``.  If either of those don't work, there's probably
some problem with your Python installation.

``extractframes`` is tested with Python versions 2.5 through 2.7
